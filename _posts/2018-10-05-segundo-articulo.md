You are most likely a combination of any of the following 4 basic body types. So don’t worry, just do the hard work based on your body type and follow your meal plan. If you don’t eat properly, you won’t shape your best body. Its possible to have layers of fat covering those hard-earned muscles!

**Training Techniques That Are Good For All Body Types**

**a)** Jump training (plyometrics) and other high-speed exercises can be incorporated into any workout for all body types. **Plyometrics and high-speed training will give your body better definition** and give you faster results. That is why athletes’ bodies are so well defined. Good jump training exercises are squat jumps, pike jumps, depth jumps, jump rope and box jumps.

**b)** Similarly, sprinting is one of the best body sculptor exercises available. Avoid long, steady-state cardio sessions (defined as 40 minutes or more) unless you are a beginner or recovering from illness or injuries. Too many slow, long, steady-state cardio sessions have been proven to waste away your valuable muscle mass.

**Basic Body Types**

Body types for women can be broken down into 4 basic types. **Keep in mind that every woman needs to do core exercises like planks**, bridges, bird dogs, cobras and back extensions regardless of body type. And, sprint interval cardio sessions (20 minutes per session) are superior for fat-burning and heart-health purposes. Some women may need extra ab work.

**Body Type 1**

A woman with a thin, linear shape is an ectomorph. **Muscle mass needs to be built on the entire body**. A woman with this body type has trouble gaining muscle mass.

**Good strength exercises for body type 1:**

Concentrate on compound movements like squats, bench press, deadlift, lunges, step ups, shoulder press and bentover rows to build major muscle groups and add definition to your body. **Single joint exercises like calf raises**, triceps dips, biceps curls and leg curls are needed to a lesser degree.

If you are an ectomorph, make sure you eat enough! Many times, a woman with a thin, linear body type can “eat anything she wants” and still have trouble gaining weight! Or, she will “eat like a bird” and remain skinny. So, weight training and proper eating is critical for building muscle if you have this body type.

**Body Type 2**

You have thin arms and legs with excess fat in the mid-section of your body. You need to burn abdominal fat and build muscle mass in the other parts of your body.
  
Belly fat causes serious health problems! Scientist have learned much more about fat cells (adipose tissue) than ever before.

Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found that abdominal fat **cells secrete inflammatory proteins that cause damage to blood** vessels and other cells, leading to diseases like cancer, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome.

Of course, don’t just focus on your belly fat. Focus on burning total body fat with full body circuit strength training and short, intense cardio sessions.

Strength exercises for fat loss should focus on maximizing your time at the gym. Build more muscle mass to speed up your metabolism and burn more fat.

**Good strength exercises for body type 2:**

Upper body: bench press, pullups, tricep pushdowns, shoulder press, one-arm bentover rows and biceps curl.

Lower body: squats, lunges, step ups, deadlift, calf raises and leg curls.

Abdominal area: ab ball curl ups, reverse knee ups, hanging leg raises, back extensions, bridges, planks, medicine ball chops and medicine ball trunk rotations.

**Body Type 3**

You are petite in your upper body and heavy in your lower body. Build muscle mass in your upper body and burn fat and tone your hips, thighs and butt. **Exercise your body in all 3 planes of motion to improve the 3-D shape of your arms**, shoulders, chest, back, butt, hips and thighs. An example would be a grouping of walking lunges, side lunges and transverse lunges.

**Good strength exercises for body type 3:**

Upper body: Bench press, pullups, lateral/front raises, tricep pushdowns, shoulder press, one-arm bentover row and bicep curls are all good exercises. You will need to challenge yourself with heavier weights to build muscle (you won’t get bulky)!

Lower body: Do light weight circuit training with high repetitions (10-12) to burn lower body fat (squats, lunges, step ups, leg curls, cable leg abductions/adductions, etc.). **Also, incorporate other one-legged exercises such as power step ups, single leg squats, single leg good mornings**, single leg medicine ball exercises, etc. These types of exercises are more intense than two-legged exercises. High-speed jump training is also effective for this body type.

Good jump training exercises are squat jumps, pike jumps, depth jumps, jump rope and box jumps. Sprint interval cardio also works well for this body type.

**Body Type 4**

This is your body type if you have wide shoulders and a narrow waist. You tend to gain weight evenly throughout your body. You are probably athletic.

**You will need a full body fat burning program**. Light weight circuit training with high repetitions (10-12) works best. High-speed jump training is also effective.

You tend to be muscular with large bones and thick joints. Due to having more muscle mass, you usually don’t have weight problems unless you overeat and undertrain. **You will also respond to weight training by building muscle mass much faster than other body types.**

You probably know where your body stores the most fat. When you train, don’t neglect areas of your body. And, spot training certain areas, such as abs, won’t work. But, you can do extra work for problem areas.

**Go to work and start shaping a sexier body!**
