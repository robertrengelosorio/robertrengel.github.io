In this article I will explain in detail the intermittent fasting protocol called **Lean Gains**, created by **Martin Berkhan** in 2013 for its website, which has the same name as the protocol. It is a protocol that I have practiced with assiduity in the past and that I strongly recommend given its ease, being much less restrictive than other more aggressive protocols and above all because it can be customized much to cover many scenarios and many schedules.

#### ADVANTAGES OF FASTING

Before entering into the protocol itself I would like to recall some of the advantages of intermittent fasting in a very summary way.

1. Increase **insulin sensitivity**
2. Promotes the oxidation of fats
3. Significantly increases growth hormone levels
4. Promotes autophagy and **cell regeneration**
5. Improves the lipid profile and reduces triglycerides
6. Increases longevity and reduces aging
7. **Reduces inflammatory markers**
8. It has potential benefits in brain and cardiovascular health
9. It seems to limit the growth of tumor cells
10. Improves the relationship with food, reduces anxiety and improves social life.

Seeing all this would be logical for everyone to throw themselves into intermittent fasting, and while it is true that fasting is a very interesting tool, the reality is that many advantages overlap with simple caloric restriction or physical exercise. . **Or simply improve the quality of the diet or improve the rest.**

This must be taken into account. **Fasting is very interesting, but it is not magic.**

#### LEANGAINS PROTOCOL

Given the advantages as a summary, we will directly explain the protocol that concerns us.

The main characteristic of **Leangains** is that it divides the day into two periods: **one of fasting of 16 hours and another of feeding of 8 hours**. That is, every day that you practice this protocol you will be 16 hours without eating and all the amount of food that you have to consume will be done in 8 hours. These 8 hours are obviously followed, **not the 8 hours you want within a 24 hour period**. The day is divided into 2 defined blocks.

Hence, he says **that this method is less aggressive than other types of fasting**, since there are other protocols that have a fasting period of 20 hours a day and this means that fewer people are able to follow it and the adherence shines by its absence.

Remember, **clear priorities first of all**. Fasting would be at the third level of importance and you have to have the first two levels clear before you start to fiddle with intermittent fasting protocols.

Do not you know what I mean by this of the levels? Read this article and it will be clear to you. Being clear that we have 8 hours to eat and 16 hours of fasting, Martin offers us 4 options so that you can choose the one that **best suits your lifestyle**. Let's see them.

#### OPTION 1 - FASTING TRAINING

In this protocol, fasting training would be carried out.

After this, a meal would be made immediately after, which Martin recommends that it be the most copious. 3 hours later we would have a second lighter meal and 3 hours later we would have the last meal of the day before **starting the fasting period**. It would be something like this:

**11:30 - 12AM or 10-15 minutes pre-workout:** 10 grams of BCAAs.

**12 - 1PM:** Training.

**1PM:** Post-training meal (the biggest of the day, we'll talk about this later).

**4PM:** Second meal.

**9PM:** Last meal before fasting.

#### NOTES

- No need to make 3 meals. We can make two meals, although at the level of results it is probably better to make 3 meals and distribute the protein evenly among the 3 doses.
- Martin recommends consuming **BCAAs** before training to avoid muscle catabolism, but recent studies have shown the poor efficacy of branched amino acids, so I would replace it with Whey.

#### OPTION 2 - EARLY TRAINING IN FASTES

This will also have a fasting training, but it is for those who train very early.

In the initial protocol Martin recommended doing 3 shots of BCAAs (**one before training and two post-training, just after training and 2 hours later**) to delay the time when we started eating, but in my opinion if this is done protocol I would recommend moving the feeding period before and ending it earlier too.

The idea of being several hours consuming **BCAAs** without eating after training, seen the recent studies, I do not just convince and I can not recommend to maximize the results. Simply count 8 hours after training and consume 2-3 mixed meals to taste and when they finish these 8 hours, **start the daily fast.**

#### OPTION 3 - A PRE-TRAINING MEAL

As its name indicates, in this option we will make a pre-workout meal that will occupy approximately 25% of the calories of the day and 1/3 of the amount of protein. Post-training we will make the main meal of the day, **which will consist of 40-50% of the calories of the day and 3 hours after a last meal similar to the first**.

An example would be the following:

**13:00** Pre-workout meal (20-25% of daily kcal).

**16: 00-17: 30** Training. Let a couple or three hours pass from the first meal.

**18:00** Post-training (the biggest meal of the day).

**21:00** Last meal before fasting.

#### OPTION 4 - TWO MEALS BEFORE THE TRAINING

Exactly like the previous one, but instead of a meal, we will make two meals before training. This option is for people who train in the afternoon and want to fast in the morning. In this case, the most important meal would be the last one, with 50% of the total calories approximately.

> #### *This option is for people who train in the afternoon and want to fast in the morning*

**Example**

**13:00** Lunch 1. With 20-25% of daily calories.

**16:00** Pre-workout meal, similar to the first one.

**19:00**  Training

**21:00** Post-workout meal, with 50% of daily calories.
