Cooked as food by itself or mixed with other foods as an ingredient, **eggs are incredibly versatile since they can be prepared in many ways**. Mixed, fried, scrambled, poached, hard-cooked, baked, stirred in, and omelet, here are 5 facts about the eggs in your daily diet you may not know of.

**Does water or milk really affect scrambled eggs?**

The process of cooking eggs into fluffy mounds is called protein coagulation. When the eggs are exposed to heat the proteins unfold to form that latticed gel. **Water dilutes the proteins so the eggs become puffed**. The fat in milk coats the protein molecules so the protein can’t bind well. Thus, when you have a 50-50 mix of water and milk, you cook up fluffy and tender scrambled eggs that’s perfect for your breakfast diet.

**Age doesn’t matter**

How old should eggs be to be better when cooked? 7 weeks is the limit of eggs before they start going bad. **Egg white begins to thin out at 5 weeks**. Of course, nothing beats fresh-farmed eggs, but in matters of quality when cooked, it doesn’t matter; they all taste the same in any breakfast diet.

> AA eggs have thicker whites while A eggs have softer yolks

**Do egg sizes matter?**

In matters of taste and quality, all eggs are the same. The common B-grade in supermarkets are the most commonly sold in the mass market. There are rare AA-grade and A-grade eggs that are pricier. AA eggs have thicker whites while A eggs have softer yolks.

**Do brighter yolks mean fresher eggs?**

No. The yellow in egg yolks come from plant pigments called xanthophyll that hens get from their food. **Thus, the yolk color will depend on what the hens are eating**. Corn and alfalfa feeds provide more yellow pigment than barley and wheat feeds do.

**When adding eggs as an ingredient, will it make a difference if the eggs are added one at a time or all at once?**

It all depends what works best for you; you can add eggs one at a time by breaking each one in turn, or you can premix the eggs. It doesn’t matter. Some people prefer premixing especially when creamed butter and sugar are needed.
