Undoubtedly, one of the points that most concern those who have decided to change their eating habits and try to improve their nutrition is to know what to do when they can not follow the diet and have to eat out. There is a pretty important panic.

This fear is largely due to restrictive diets that have been followed before and that have created a bad relationship with food that can significantly alter our quality of life and our social agenda.

In this article I want to give you some simple and very practical guidelines so that eating out is not an ordeal and an element of anguish and that begins to be what you should, a quality time with people you appreciate.

Let's go there.

## Starting point

Let's start with the most basic and I want to be clear and meridian.

Everyone knows that eating a salad on Saturday night if the rest of your week has been full of junk food does not have any kind of significance. That is, a diet is not arranged by a salad.

That is clear, but when we put the opposite example it costs much more to understand and many people believe that the world ends, and it is not true. If your day to day is full of quality food (ie eggs, meat, fish, nuts, vegetables, fruits, vegetables, cereals, etc ...) that you eat outside on Saturday night will not have an important impact on your results in the medium term. Come on, that adding the second part of the sentence would look something like this:

The only way I could do it is if, when you go out, you are in such an outdated state that you have bingeed several thousand calories without stopping. This is not normal and is mainly due to two problems:

- Some psychological problem much deeper, for which I have no tools to fix it in this blog and you should deal with a professional who really helps you.

- You have a diet of shit, too restrictive both in calories and in food options. So when you get to this event that in principle should not assume anything serious you are so hungry and so many cravings that you literally can not stop eating and can not exercise the slightest control. To do this, stop making this "diet" and start thinking about a restructuring feed with feet and head should become priority number 1.

Leaving these two cases aside, we are going to talk about the great majority of people who are not included in the groups mentioned above. Those who have a more or less correct diet and those who can maintain control.

Having said that, we will differentiate several situations in which we can find ourselves and I will give you specific and very simple recommendations for each of the cases.

## CASE 1

NON-ADVANCE MEAL IN SITE GUARRO

In this case we have an improvised meal (leaving work is decided at the time to go out to dinner) and the group would like to dine in a place that you know that there will be no healthy option. See fast food chain pizzeria, a kebab or something similar.

This is the most tricky case, because I would recommend (for psychological health mainly) that you underestimate these options that surely have crossed your mind:

1. Do not go. Let's see, if this going to very dirty places is recurrent, the case may come that you decide that this group of friends is not the most appropriate to go out to eat frequently. But if it's a sporadic case, I would not recommend you leave.

2. Order food in a separate place and go to the restaurant. I think it's a hassle for both you and the others, other than likely not to be let in with food from other establishments.

3. Go but not eat. Well, you're going to be the freak who's going to watch while everyone is eating. The sounds of your stomach and the slobber of your mouth are probably not to the liking of the other diners. Have the courtesy to notify them.

This is the case in which the previous sentence becomes more relevant. Do not worry, it will not affect your results in the medium term. Really not. Eat and calm down You know that every day you eat well, that your diet is adequate and that tomorrow you will be "on track" again. Enjoy, have fun and ready.

Of course, for the fans of self-sabotage I ask you please that the next day DO NOT WEAR.

Why? Well because obviously you will weigh more (you have eaten more, you have more food in your digestive system, maybe you have retained some water, ...) and if you weigh yourself in these circumstances you are going to take a bad drink.

And the fucker is that many weigh themselves in these circumstances knowing in advance that the weight will not like them, but they do it equally to wallow in their misery. If you ate more than you normally eat yesterday, that's it. Turning page. Do not weigh yourself, do not corroborate it if you are not going to be calm with the result. Point. Make your life easier

## CASE 2

ADVANCE EAT IN SITE GUARRO

In this second case we go back to eating in a dirty place but this time we have some room for maneuver because we already knew beforehand. Several previous points apply:

- If this is something very recurrent, maybe you should not go out so much with these people.

- I do not recommend not going, or not eating, or bringing food from outside or tupper.

That said, as we have had a reasonable time to prepare we can make some alterations prior to this event to minimize the impact of this meal. Among others we have the following:

1. Go to train that day. Psychologically it always relaxes the fact of having done an intense training prior to making a less advisable meal. If you are going to a place that you know that food is very caloric ... put more training volume. Without fear. Add some series here and there and leave the skin in the room. The extra caloric later will be responsible for helping your recovery.

2. Reduce the meal that day. We mainly talk about fats since fast food chains are famous for having extremely greasy foods. Nowadays everybody is scared with hydrates, but really there are many fast food dishes and ultraprocessed products that have many more calories coming from fat than from hydrates. Look for example at McDonald's Sweet BBQ Bacon!

3. We have 40 grams of fat that give a total of 360 kcal (almost half of the whole hamburger) while hydrates we have 62 grams, or what is equivalent to 248 kcal. Let's not forget that fat is also extremely palatable, that it has more than twice as many calories as carbohydrates and that it is very easy to reach a caloric surplus with a very high fat diet if they are from ultra-processed products.

So in my opinion, if you are going to restrict something, that is the fats mainly that day.

4. If you go to a dinner, fasting is your best ally.

5. Obviously, everything you can save better than better. That is, you can ask for water instead of getting 1 liter of Coca-Cola between your chest and back. You can order the Coca-Cola Zero and you avoid getting those almost 90 grams of sugar in your body. You know, viable options.

6. Probably if you have eaten a lot on this site the next day you get up still satiated and / or full. It is normal and has to do with leptin levels. In simple, our body does not want to be in prolonged caloric surplus, so if one day you give a very large excess leptin levels will increase consistently and will make your hunger is reduced. It's a way of saying "yesterday you passed, today you control".

A lot of attention with this to compensate the food of the day to "square" a dirty food. This is a double-edged sword, because we can get to make coffee with the excuse of compensating for food and end up worsening the results.

That is, it is not uncommon to see cases kicked out of people who believe that because they "eat a multivitamin" they have a free way to eat worse since the micronutrients are already obtained through the supplement.

It is not uncommon to see people who "like getting sunscreen" justify being almost three months a year taking 6 hours a day the sun until they are churruscadas.

And it is not uncommon to see people who like to compensate their diet to put less recommended products ends up consuming much more of these than if it had not compensated in the first place ....

If you are clear that this is a sporadic measure, go ahead. If you use it to eat worse, we go wrong and you have not understood the message.

## CASE 3

NON-ADVANCE MEAL IN CORRECT SITE

By right site I do not mean a site that you have to mortgage to ask for an appetizer. I mean a restaurant that has a wider selection of dishes, such as salads, meats, fish, etc ... In this case there should be no problem.

You have enough options to make a less healthy meal within the possibilities of that restaurant. Let's see several points that you can apply:

- If dishes are made to snack, look for light and easily digested alternatives and share with others.

- First you can start with a salad, which will most likely satisfy you while you control calories as much as possible.

- Of second course you have the option of choosing something that you do not consume frequently. That is, you can choose fish if you do not usually add them to your diet habitually, so you will take advantage to include that day something nutritious that you do not usually eat.

- You always have alternatives and there are small changes to make. If you want to control to the maximum, for example, you can change the accompaniment for salad, or if you put fried potatoes you can always choose baked potatoes. Be creative.

- There is always room for dessert. But you can split it with someone, so that you stay with the good taste in your mouth but you have not eaten so much, better than better. Sometimes we see life in black and white and our thinking is "or not like NOTHING, or I put myself up my ass and lost to the river". There is a gamma of grays immense between these two points of view, and I think that's where the balance lies.

- It has also been seen in studies that the order in which we consume food can alter our appetite. That is, if we focus on vegetables first, then a source of lean protein or more fat and then we add the hydrates we will probably be more satiated, so we will consume less at the end of the meal.

## CASE 4

ADVANCE MEAL IN CORRECT SITE

Little more to add to this case. It is the simplest of the four scenarios.

We know in advance that we have this event so we can take measures accordingly, either reducing the calories the same day or later, we can train, we can reduce carbohydrates, we can fast, etc ...

We also go to a site that has a wider selection of dishes, so we can take the previous tips as valid and applicable. So ... nothing more to add.

## SUMMARIZING

Thinking about nutrition as something white or black is the prelude to many problems, such as obsession, orthorexia, feeding behavior disorders, bad relationships with food, etc ...

You must understand that life must have a degree of flexibility and that you must allow yourself not to do everything 100% at any time without negatively affecting your results or your head. Give yourself the freedom of not always being perfect and understand that if you lead an adequate lifestyle and a healthy diet a single day doing things wrong or "not perfect" will not alter the results in any significant way.

I hope it has served you.
