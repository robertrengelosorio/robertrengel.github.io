On protein there are many doubts in the world of fitness. Many. It is the star macronutrient, and **for that reason people who attend the gym literally eat their heads trying to optimize their consumption**, both in total daily amount and how many times they need to consume protein and how much per shot.

In this article we are going to answer the last question, since I have received several mails lately asking about this and it is a topic that I had not yet addressed in my web, so it is time to resolve this doubt once and for all.

Go for it.

###**PREVIOUS ANNOTATIONS**

Before starting with the subject in question I would like to make clear a series of things that I believe are essential before proceeding. In a very schematic way.

1. Regardless of the number of meals that seem to be optimal and the maximum protein per sitting that our body can take advantage of to maximize protein synthesis ... do not be fooled. The most important thing is and will remain the total protein per day. If you have not read my article about **CLEAR PRIORITIES**, I highly recommend it since it is one of the most important articles of the blog and a must before moving on to more advanced topics such as the amount of protein per sitting.
2. Speaking of total protein remember that many people in the world are wishing you think you need much more protein than you really need, because part of the money they earn comes from promoting protein supplements. **Therefore, it is very lucrative for all these individuals to get into your head the need and the fear that you need an exorbitant amount of daily protein**, and if you do not get to that you will be losing all your muscle mass, because in that context it is very much Easier you end up resorting to smoothies and supplements to cover that ridiculous amount. And that's when all these people make a cut, of having created a need that did not exist in the first place.
3. Remember, the amount needed to build muscle mass in a caloric surplus is 1.8-2 grams / kg of daily weight. It is not so much protein. And if you are in caloric deficit, it may be advisable to raise that amount slightly, being able to reach a maximum of 2.7 grams / kg of weight. **I repeat, it is not so much protein, and certainly much less than what people usually believe.** Consuming more protein than necessary is not only useless, but you will be losing money (protein is expensive), you will be displacing the consumption of other nutrients much more interesting in that context (fats and hydrates mainly) and even an excessive consumption of protein can lead to decreased levels of testosterone, both free and total.

###**BASE PROBLEM**

Another issue that I think it **is necessary to solve before continuing is the misconception** that many people have when we talk about the question that concerns us. I explain.

Many people ask **"how much protein can our body absorb in one sitting"**, when what they really want to ask is "how much protein in one sitting can our body use to synthesize muscle or use it for hypertrophy".

It is important to emphasize this, because the second question is what matters, while the first (and what most people ask) is easy to answer. All Literally, the body has a virtually unlimited capacity to absorb nutrients and calories. That is, it can absorb a lot of protein by sitting, another thing is that it is optimal to maximize muscle growth.

However, if you were not able to absorb more than 20 grams (**a number that many people believe is the limit of absorption and that is coincidentally similar to the protein in a Whey supplement dipper**) each time you consume more than 20 grams of protein suddenly you would have a tremendous decomposition and go straight to the bathroom.

It does not happen. Why? Because our body can absorb almost everything you throw at it. You have to spend a lot so that your body is not able to absorb something that you have eaten. I'm talking about several thousand calories.

I hope that this point is already clear ^^

###**RESOLVING THE DOUBT**

Once we have all the above clear, we will solve the question that concerns us.

What is the limit of protein per sitting that our body can use to build muscle mass?

The amount of protein we are looking for is based, mainly, **on the amount of optimal leucine that is needed to stimulate muscle growth.** We know today that leucine is the main amino acid that regulates the mTOR pathway, which is responsible for muscle growth, so ensuring that there is enough leucine in each meal becomes a priority to optimize results.

Be very careful, because now we can fall into the trap of thinking that we have to consume leucine to failure to maximize muscle gains. Nothing is further from reality. **There comes a point where more leucine is not necessary and consuming more simply is redundant.**
How much leucine is necessary? Approximately 2.5 to 3 grams per sitting, although there are some studies that have observed that 1.8 grams is enough to maximize protein synthesis.

But to be sure, **we will move in the range of 2.5-3 grams per meal**. And knowing this, we are going to transfer it to a total amount of protein per sitting, which is the question we want to resolve.

For this we are going to refer to a review carried out by Alan Aragon and Brad Schoenfeld on this same topic in February 2018 and that concluded the following:

> Based on the available evidence, we conclude that to maximize anabolism one should consume protein in a range of 0.4 g / kg / meal divided by a minimum of 4 meals to reach the recommended minimum of 1.6 g / kg / day. Using the highest range of 2.2 g / kg / day of protein and distributing it in the same amount of meals we would need 0.55 g / kg / meal.

That is, assuming an approximate weight **range of 70-90kg** for a healthy adult male and 48-68kg for a healthy adult woman, we would have the following approximate ranges of protein per sitting:

**MALES:** 28-40 grams of protein in the low range and 36-50 in the high.
**WOMEN:** 20-26 grams in the low range and 27-37 in the high.

Obviously if we weigh more or less we will have to adapt the quantities. We are talking about very general numbers.

In that amount of protein by sitting and at that frequency, given the evidence, protein synthesis is maximized since in each sitting there will be enough leucine to activate the mTOR pathway.

###**LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY**

Despite this, there are some limitations in it, that Menno Henselmans on his website comments very accurately and I will just share with you.

1. Most studies included in the review mentioned use Whey as the main source of protein. That has an important bias since whey protein has a very high absorption rate **that is not representative when compared to other protein-rich foods.** For example, 70 grams of veal protein had a higher anabolic response and stimulated more protein synthesis than 40 grams of beef.
2. A previous fast potentiates the anabolic response of the subsequent meal, so it is feasible that after a fast the above mentioned limit increases.
3. The more muscle mass we have, the greater the capacity for growth our body has and therefore, **the greater amount of protein our body can take advantage** of. That is, a torso or fullbody workout will probably increase our ability to synthesize muscle mass much more than a biceps workout. An extra point in favor of the routines that provide more frequency and train more muscles per session.

It is also important to note that there is a significant number of studies that observe that reducing **the frequency of meals from 7-6 to 2-3 a day does not have an effect on muscle** mass retention or fat loss. We are talking about studies done in people in deficit.

Hence, intermittent fasting, as well as its best-known variant "Lean Gains" are very valuable tools when it comes to carrying out a satisfactory definition. However, this can not be applied to cases of volume or caloric surplus in trained people, since unfortunately there are no studies of these characteristics.

**SUMMARIZING**

- The body has a virtually unlimited capacity to absorb calories and nutrients.
- That a very high amount of protein can be absorbed does not mean that it will be used to build muscle mass efficiently
- Given the current evidence it seems **that 3-4 meals of between 30-50 grams of protein in each in men and 20-40 grams in women** seems to be a good way to proceed and optimize results.
- In deficit it has been seen, however, that lowering even 2 meals a day whenever enough protein is consumed does not have harmful effects when it comes to retaining muscle mass or losing body fat.
- What brings us to the most important point, the priority should be to consume enough protein per day. With this we make sure an 8/10. If we want to reach 10/10, follow the instructions in this article.
